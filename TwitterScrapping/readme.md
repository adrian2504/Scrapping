Using snscrape is much faster than Tweepy that requires developer profile to be setup and using access tokens. Which is great for security and for a secured scrapping procedure.

Snscrape is another approach for scraping information from Twitter that does not require the use of an API. Snscrape allows you to scrape basic information such as a user's profile, tweet content, source, and so on.

Snscrape is not limited to Twitter, but can also scrape content from other prominent social media networks like Facebook, Instagram, and others.

Its advantages are that there are no limits to the number of tweets you can retrieve or the window of tweets (that is, the date range of tweets). So Snscrape allows you to retrieve old data.

But the one disadvantage is that it lacks all the other functionalities of Tweepy â€“ still, if you only want to scrape tweets, Snscrape would be enough.


If you want to acquire an endless number of tweets, you should use Snscrape. But if you want to use extra features that Snscrape cannot provide (like geolocation, for example), then you should definitely use Tweepy. It is directly integrated with the Twitter API and provides complete functionality.
